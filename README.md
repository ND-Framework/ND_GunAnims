## **How to configure holster animations**

To configure the holster animations for different weapons you can do it in `ND_GunAnims/data/animations.lua`

#### info.animations

This is where you create the animations and give them names. Let's use this example:
```lua
police = {
    holster = { dict = "reaction@intimidation@cop@unarmed", clip = "intro", duration = 400, clothing = 300 },
    unholster = { dict = "rcmjosh4", clip = "josh_leadout_cop2", duration = 300, clothing = 0, cancel = true }
}
```
* `holster`: played when you holster the weapon.
* `unholster`: played when you pull out the weapon.
  * `dict`: animation dictionary.
  * `clip`: animation name.
  * `duration`: how long the animation will play.
  * `clothing`: optional and only needed if you use the animation with clothing in info.clothing. It is the time in ms of how long into the animtion the clothing component will change.
  * `cancel`: will cancel the animation when half the duration is reached.


#### info.default

The default anim for weapons not found in groups, weapons, or clothing.


#### info.weaponGroups

Animation name by weapon groups can be found here: https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0xC3287EE3050FB74C
This is a list of relevant weapon groups:
* `GROUP_HEAVY`
* `GROUP_MELEE`
* `GROUP_MG`
* `GROUP_PISTOL`
* `GROUP_RIFLE`
* `GROUP_SHOTGUN`
* `GROUP_SMG`
* `GROUP_SNIPER`
* `GROUP_STUNGUN`
* `GROUP_THROWN`
* `GROUP_UNARMED`

#### info.weapons

Animation name by weapon hash, if you add a weapon here it will ignore the animation on it's group and instead play a specific animation set here.

#### info.clothing

Animation by clothing component, if wearing specific clothing such as a holster then everything else ignored and that anim is used.

* `holster`: animations played based on clothing when weapon is holstered.
* `unholster`: animations played based on clothing when weapon is unholstered.

  * `anim`: animation name in info.animations.
  * `weapons`: list of weapons that this is valid for.
  * `variation`: variation for the clothing components.
  * `male`: clothing components for male anim will be valid for.
